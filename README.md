# CVIP-Email-Spam-Detection-
Email spam detection is a critical application of data science and machine learning in our digital age. In my recent project, I tackled this challenge by utilizing powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The cornerstone of my approach was the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer, which transformed raw email text into numerical features, capturing the importance of words within each email. The heart of the spam detection system was a Logistic Regression model, a robust choice for binary classification tasks like spam vs. legitimate email. After extensive training and fine-tuning, my model achieved an impressive 96% accuracy rate, a testament to its ability to effectively distinguish between spam and ham emails.
